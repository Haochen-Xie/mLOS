mLOS
====

*mLOS* is an abbreviation of *m*icro *L*ua *O*bject *S*ystem, which
tries to provide a simple, easy to use, and yet powerful object system
for lua language. mLOS is all written in lua itself so you can use it
whatever you need a object system.

*mLOS* supports fields, methods, constructor, multiple inheritance and
instance checking by far. The only file you need is mLOS.lua. To get
start, check document.lua please.
